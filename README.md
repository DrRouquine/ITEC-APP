## Resources
Sources:

I am reviewing the following sources to determine what features the APP should focus on:

Based on the report's evaluation criteria, the app can offer self-assessment tools for candidates to evaluate their readiness and areas for growth.
A library of resources focused on culturally responsive teaching and diversity in education could be included.
Features that facilitate mentorship and networking among candidates and experienced educators.
Tools for reflective practice and feedback loops to encourage continuous learning and adaptation.
